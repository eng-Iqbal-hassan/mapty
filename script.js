// The website is all about data and there is no meaning of web page without data.
// Here in our case the data is directly coming from the UI 
// log my running workout with location, distance, time, pace and steps/minutes.
// log my cycling workout with location, distance, time, pace and elevation gain.

// So we need to build the structure that user data filled by the input fields should be added in an object.

// So using ES6, there will be child two child classes running and cycling and there is one parent class workout.

// distance, duration and coords properties will be in parent class Parent class also have the properties like id and date and the need of these properties will be seen while coding. Child class cycling will take these 3 properties and will have two further properties cadence and pace. while child class running elevation gain and speed. Thats all about data
// in classes structure be like 
// properties, constructor and then add the methods.

// At this point we have our different logics working like receive geolocation position, click on map, change input and submit form and all are separate chunks.

// Now we will have one class with name app which have all the stuff mention above in the one code block

//it will contain (1): Workout array -> Array holding all running and cycling objects (2): Map 
// (3): constructor -> Load page (4): _getPosition() method
// (5): _loadMap() to receive position (6): _showForm() -> click on map (7): _toggleElevationFields -> when input type is changed (8): _newWorkout() -> submit form and all the data filled in this method will go to the workouts array. 

// Lecture 10: Implementation the Architecture

// class with the name and snippet is mentioned above

// Lecture 11: Managing workout data Creating classes
// implement classes to manage the data for cycling and running workout that are coming from the UI.
// There is the concept of parent and child classes as Distance and duration is present in both cycling and running while cadence is present in running while elevation gain is present in cycling. 

// Lecture 12: Creating a new workout


// use the locale storage api in order to make the workout data persist in multiple reload

// The idea is that when a new workout is added the whole workout array is stored in the locale storage.

// And when the page is loaded all the workouts are loaded from locale storage and rendered in the UI.
